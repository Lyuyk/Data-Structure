## Labs

- [x] Lab1: Students Health System
  - [x] inserting new student information into the student health table (describing the insertion point by position number)
  - [x] deleting information about a specific student in the health table (by student number)
  - [x] modifying physical information for a student (by student number)
  - [x] sorting by student number and displaying the results
  - [x] querying student information in the health table 
  - [x] enter all student information on the screen
  - [x] read all student health form information from the file
  - [x] write all student health form information to the file
- [x] Lab2: Address List
  - [x] search for students in the address book (by student number)
  - [x] search for students in the address book (by name)
  - [x] search for students in the address book (by phone number)
  - [x] delete students in the address book (first locate the student being deleted by searching in 3-5 above)
  - [x] output the information for the youngest student
  - [x] output all student information on the screen (you can choose whether to iterate through it in pre-order, mid-order or post-order)
  - [x] read the address book information from the file
  - [x] write the student address book information to the file;
- [x] Lab3: Decompress/Compress the text(Huffman Tree)
  - [x] Initialization. Read in the character set size n and the n characters and n weights from the terminal, build the Huffman tree and store it in the file hfmTree. 
  - [x] Encoding. Using the constructed Huffman tree (or read from the file hfmTree if it is not in memory), encode the text in the file ToBeTran and store the result in the file CodeFile. 
  - [x] Decoding. The code in the file CodeFile is decoded using the constructed Huffman tree and the result is stored in the file TextFile. 
  - [x] Print the code file. The file CodeFile is displayed on the screen in a compact format with 50 binary codes per line. The code file in character form is also written to the file CodePrin. 
  - [x]  Printing of the Huffman tree. Displays the Huffman tree already in memory in a visual format (tree or recessed) on the screen and writes the Huffman tree in character form to the TreePrin file. 
  - [x] Other auxiliary functions: The source/target file for each conversion operation is specified by the user when selecting this operation.
